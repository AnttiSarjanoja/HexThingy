# Turn resolution

Turn resolution order:

1. Beast boon exploration orders
1. Magic orders (!) - Magic really messes up everything so all orders must be validated again when run
1. Move orders inside friendly territory
1. Other move orders (in what order?)
1. Combat
1. Building orders
1. Settling orders
1. Advancing orders
1. Resource + people grown tick
1. Tithe orders
1. Exploration orders

Note that all orders are immediately validated when sent - e.g. advancement is not possible to achieve
